# MCEF (Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework)

MCEF is a mod and library for adding the Chromium web browser into Minecraft.

**Support & Discussion:** https://discord.gg/rhayah27GC

**Current Chromium version:** `116.0.5845.190`

## VulkanMod Add-on (Fabric / Minecraft 1.21.11)

This repository also provides a **separate, client-only compatibility add-on** in [`vulkan-addon`](vulkan-addon/README.md). It replaces only the upload/presentation of completed MCEF browser frames with VulkanMod's GPU backend. Chromium/JCEF, browser input, downloads and the original MCEF artifacts remain unchanged.

Install the add-on **alongside** MCEF from this branch and VulkanMod for 1.21.11. It does not bundle or replace either mod. Build it with `./gradlew :vulkan-addon:build` after preparing JCEF; see the [add-on documentation](vulkan-addon/README.md) for dependencies, development setup, API limitations and the verification checklist. There is no NeoForge add-on, as VulkanMod is Fabric-only. An in-game Vulkan compatibility test is still required.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10/11 (x86_64, arm64)*
- macOS 11 or greater (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- GNU Linux glibc 2.31 or greater (x86_64, arm64)**

**This mod will not work on Android.**

## Using MCEF in Your Projects

Snapshots and releases are mirrored on a static Maven repository hosted at `https://keksuccino.github.io/maven/`. Add the repository to your build script, then depend on the loader-specific artifact you need. Artifacts follow the pattern `de.keksuccino:<mod_id>-<loader>:<mod_version>-<minecraft_version>`.

### Fabric

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = "https://keksuccino.github.io/maven/" }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "de.keksuccino:mcef-fabric:2.2.0-1.21.11"
}
```

Replace the MCEF and Minecraft version as required. `modImplementation` makes MCEF available in dev.

### NeoForge

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = "https://keksuccino.github.io/maven/" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "de.keksuccino:mcef-neoforge:2.2.0-1.21.11"
}
```

NeoForge ships deobfuscated jars by default, so the dependency can be declared with a plain `implementation`. Replace the MCEF and Minecraft version as required.

## Building & Modifying MCEF

After cloning this repo, you will need to clone the java-cef git submodule. There is a gradle task for this: `./gradlew cloneJcef`.

To run the Fabric client: `./gradlew fabricClient`
To run the NeoForge client: `./gradlew neoforgeClient`

In-game, there is a demo browser if you press F12 after you're loaded into a world (the demo browser only exists when you're running from a development environment).

## Clearing MCEF Cache

MCEF skips the downloader screen once it detects that all required files are present. Remove the following paths to force a fresh download and clean browser data:

- **Binary bundle (production builds):** `<game directory>/mods/mcef-libraries`
- **Binary bundle (development runs):** `<repo>/fabric/build/mcef-libraries` or `<repo>/neoforge/build/mcef-libraries` (the folder next to the active module's `build` directory)
- **Checksum files:** any `<platform>.tar.gz.sha256` inside the relevant `mcef-libraries` folder; removing these alongside the binaries guarantees the downloader runs again
- **JCEF profile/cache:** `<game directory>/mods/mcef-cache`
- **Config overrides:** `<game directory>/config/mcef/mcef.properties` (delete or edit this file if it sets `skip-download=true`)

After clearing these locations, restart the game and the Download screen will reappear to fetch a fresh Chromium bundle.
